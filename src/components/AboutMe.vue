            Hello, my name is Victor Orozco and this is my first web page. I am a recent college graduate from Calfornia University State, Los Angeles. If you alreadey could not tell I got me degree in Computer Science. I also have two associate degrees from, College of the Desert, located in Palm Desert, California, they are in CS and mathematics. I decided to move back to Palm Springs, California, my hometown, during this past summer after finally completing school and bringing an end to an adventerous chapter in my life. I can not wait to start the next chapter of my life, wherever that may take me. In the mean time, I decided that I will remain in Palm Springs working on some projects until my next adventure begins. As for the purpose of this project, it ultimately allow me to gather data and statistics based on my behavioral patterns to better asses myself.
